	  <p>Cross out teams below as they are <em>eliminated</em> from the Euro Cup.
          The first player to complete their bingo card (according to elimination
	  time) wins.</p>
          <ul class='rules'>
	  <li>The elimination ordering is based on the <em>scheduled kickoff time</em>.</li>
          <li>The third-place game is not included. </li>
	  <li>If several players can consider their bingo card completed after
	  the same elimination, they will share the prize.</li>
	  <li>If several eliminations occur with the same kickoff time, the
	      elimination time depends on which stage the matches finish.

<p>This card has been computationally drawn randomly
according to these rules:
(source: <a href="https://github.com/stain/worldcupbingo">https://github.com/stain/worldcupbingo)</a></p>

         <ol class='gen-rules'>
            <li>The first team is chosen randomly.</li>
            <li>The group of the chosen team is removed from the
                pool of possible teams.</li>
            <li>The next team is chosen randomly from the remaining
                teams.</li>
            <li>This continues from step 2 until there are no more possible teams.</li>
            <li>When there are no more possible teams, remaining teams not
                already on the bingo card are put back into the pool,
                and the process continues from step 1 onwards until the
                card is complete.</li>
            <li>This draw is performed independently for each bingo
            card. Although theoretically two bingo boards could contain
            the same teams, for all practical purposes bingo boards will
            be unique, and will contain teams evenly drawn from across
            the groups.</li>
