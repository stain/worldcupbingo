          <p>Cross out teams below as they are eliminated from the Euro Cup.
          The first player to complete their bingo card wins.</p>
          <ul class='rules'>
          <li>The ordering is based on the date and time the eliminating
          matches are played (at the groups stage, the final match of
          the group)</li>
          <li>In the event of several players completing their bingo
            card after the same elimination, they will share the price.</li>
          <li>The third-place game is not included. </li>

<p>This card has been computationally drawn randomly
         according to these rules:</p>
         <ol class='gen-rules'>
            <li>The first team is chosen randomly.</li>
            <li>The group of the chosen team is removed from the
                pool of possible teams.</li>
            <li>The next team is chosen randomly from the remaining
                teams.</li>
            <li>This continues from step 2 until there are no more possible teams.</li>
            <li>When there are no more possible teams, remaining teams not
                already on the bingo card are put back into the pool, 
                and the process continues from step 1 onwards until the 
                card is complete.</li>  
            <li>This draw is performed independently for each bingo
            card. Although theoretically two bingo boards could contain
            the same teams, for all practical purposes bingo boards will
            be unique, and will contain teams evenly drawn from across
            the groups.</li>
